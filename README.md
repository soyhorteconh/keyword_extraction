# keyword extraction
Abstract â€” This paper aims to analyze texts and extract the
main keywords by two keyword extraction methods. The core
functionality involves extracting words from the text and com-
paring them with an online dataset. The extraction process will
use two methods: word frequency analysis, and graph-based
approaches. The core functionality involves identifying keywords
within the document and comparing them with an online dataset
to analyze further and validate the key terms.
