# Keyword Extraction

## Abstract

This paper aims to analyze texts and extract the main keywords using two keyword extraction methods. The core functionality involves extracting words from the text and comparing them with an online dataset. The extraction process will utilize two methods: word frequency analysis and graph-based approaches. The objective is to identify keywords within the document and compare them with an online dataset to analyze and validate the key terms.

## Objective

The objective of this paper is to compare two different keyword extraction methods:

1. **Classical Word Frequency Extraction**: A method that identifies keywords based on the frequency of their occurrence in the text.
2. **TopicRank (Graph-Based Approach)**: A graph-based method that ranks keywords based on their relationships within the text, leveraging graph theory.
